King Arthur was an interesting man. He was also very driven and focused. As a king, he knew that he had to do what was best
for his people. He knew that they needed protection and that he was the one that could provide it.

If only all of that was true.

In reality, the people he planned to rule over didn't care to have his protection. Especially after he called that one woman a
duck instead of a witch last week...

But that was not going to stop him. He needed to gather his knights for his round table.
